"08/11/2022","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Steve G","Mario Kart 8 DX","Listen, if you've ever played a Mario Kart game then you know what you're getting into. It's Mario Kart, but it looks better than ever. It includes the 4 cups from the original game's DLC, bringing the total tracks available to 48. Nintendo is also releasing a $25 DLC that is adding an additional 48 tracks, doubling the base game's size. It's a bargain.If you enjoyed unlocking characters, I have some bad news for you--they're all unlocked from the start. The only secret character is Gold Mario, which you can get from getting a gold trophy in all the 200cc grand prix. And the 200cc is available right when you boot up the game for the first time. Kind of a letdown if you like unlockables. Kart options unlock as you collect more coins through gameplay. This maxes at 5000 coins and gives you a golden glider. If you beat the 150cc and Mirror Mode (available as soon as you boot up the game for the first time) you get a golden kart. If you beat the staff ghosts in the 150cc time trials you get golden wheels.I was skeptical at first, but listen... it's Mario Kart. It's just fun. You won't regret buying it.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10VUIV35D6V09/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","55","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

After much trial and error, we finally found that selecting the wireless-1 player (Not 2 player), one person could create a room, and then on the 2nd switch-lite, that person also goes to wireless - 1 player (Not 2 player), and then you can see the room the other person created and join it.

It was on sale for the holidays so i had to get it while it was still cheap. As far as I know the dlc has an extra track and some more stuff . It's the same game as the wii u version in 1080p instead of the 720p that the wii u version had. I tested the game out with the optional hori mario kart steering wheel which I highly recommend for mario kart 8 owners. It provides a realistic arcade feel to the game instead of using a controller.  Getting back to the subject,  if you didn't have mario kart on the wii u , I highly recommend this game for switch owners","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71N9Z0x7qPL._SY1600.jpg","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1J4M2EFCBL2DU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

Plus you have setting options that allow you to race without having to hold down a button make your car go and you have options to turn your remote into a steering wheel instead of using your toggle sticks similar to the wii. I feel that first feature is great for little kids that want to play and the second feature is good for just a more realistic feeling while driving.

The most disappointing thing was that it advertised that it had some of the old favorite track from n64, but it was name only, the tracks were completely different and short and even the tough courses were short and easy. The hard part was every 5 seconds a racer is hitting you with something. I would also describe the tracks as over the top, just way too much happening. This was definitely targeted more for kids with ADD. I think I will return it.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3D38B7QRLO3QL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","2","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

One thing about Switch version 8 I like is that it gives options that help younger kids play it. For instance I have a six year old who is not good with the controls yet- always falling off the sides- but the game has a setting that will keep her on the road.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RP82I3QORE66O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

If you have big hands and are playing on a switch lite the touch screen controls are gonna be the destroyer of many rounds of playing. It's stupid cuz you cannot disable this setting either. You'll be mid drift or mid game and bam the game pauses. Other than this very minor detail it's an AMAZING GAME.

It was totally worth the price and it has made my experience with Nintendo switch even greater.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41kAIAUk2+L._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41x30Vb1jUL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51XB+lX89vL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZWJu644aL._SY1600.jpg","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1376WZO20OQTJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","5","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"04/21/2020","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","K. G.","Amazing visuals and performance, but left me wanting additional tracks and characters","Mario Kart 8 (Deluxe) has a lot of replay value, thanks to it’s many modes of gameplay, unlockables, online multiplayer and local multiplayer capabilities. This updated (Deluxe) version looks and performs better than ever before on the Nintendo Switch. No matter what controller setup you’re using, it’s going to feel very fluid and responsive.I’ve docked the Deluxe version of Mario Kart 8 one star, however. This is mainly due to the fact that there are actually no “real” new/additional racetracks or characters in this revamped offering on the Switch.I would have loved to have seen a couple of new cup races, even if the new racetracks were simply remasters of classic Super Mario Kart or Mario Kart 64 tracks. Anybody who played Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U has probably seen and raced every single track and cup that currently exists more times than they care to. So yes, a few additional cups or racetracks would have been a great addition.In addition to much needed additional content, it would’ve been great to finally offer a local and online 4-8 player Grand Prix mode. It’s been long awaited and let’s face it, it’s just time.I get that this could be a way to “cheat” against or exploit the shortcomings of the CPU characters and earn trophies “unfairly”. To alleviate this, they could have single player trophies and multiplayer trophies. Obtaining the single or 2-player trophies would be the only way to unlock the majority of secret characters, wheels, karts, etc., while winning the 4 to 8 player trophies would only earn coins or smaller, more trivial unlockables. All in all, I think this would be another exciting and super fun mode of gameplay to play and compete with friends.As I mentioned above, I feel there are some pretty serious character roster opportunities. Starting off, there are way too many slots for each variant of certain characters…Looking at you, Mario and Peach.Nothing’s quite as annoying than being in a race with Mario, Baby Mario, Tanooki Mario, Metal Mario...You get the idea.Why not make all of the character variants into character skins that all exist within just one character slot? It already works just fine for the Link, Yoshi, and the Shy Guy character slot variants. Each variant skin could still have it’s respective attributes, such as Tanooki Mario being a tad lighter or Metal Mario being heavier. Having so many variant slots currently makes the character selection screen look very jumbled and messy, and as I mentioned, who wants to play against a team of variants from just one character? I’d also love to see more random variations when it comes to CPU opponents’ kart kart/wheel choices. I think it goes without saying that everyone likes to see each CPU character in their standard karts and probably a bike, but a how about a few more variations to spice things up and make it feel a bit more randomized. To unlock everything you’ll be racing and seeing the same characters with the same kart combos A LOT.Lastly, my biggest beef is the actual character roster choices for this game. Namely the Inklings from Splatoon and the random selection of Animal Crossing characters. I get that these characters are technically part of the Nintendo family and belong to specific Nintendo console games, but another part of me can’t help feeling that these characters feel very out of place in the “Mario Universe“. I mean, if you’re going to add any Animal Crossing characters, why not Tom Nook, the Dodo, or K.K. Slider? I’m a huge Legend of Zelda fan, but at times, I even find myself questioning if Link really belongs or truly “fits” into the game all that well.Here are some choices I feel would have been a better” fit” or are more relevant additions to the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe roster...Mouser- Such an awesome and iconic Mario Bros. 2 throwback character. Why hasn’t he been in any Mario Kart game yet?SnifitNinjiPauline- Things are always more fun when Mario’s ex-girlfriend enters the mixKamek- Kamek was supposed to be in Mario Kart 64, but was swapped out in place of DK. Isn’t it about time we finally saw him as a playable character?Birdo- not a character I ever played as in the past, but still a relevant Mario character that just makes sense to include in any Mario Kart title.Blooper- another classic Mario baddie that really needs to be includedTryClyde- Another unique Mario Bros. 2 character worth inviting to the party.Hammer Brother- No explanation needed. Just put one in the game.Monty Mole- Just like the Hammer Brother, he’s already a playable Mario Party character. He’s been featured in several Mario Kart and non-Mario Kart titles as a non-playable character so why not include him now?The Giant Blue Penguin from Mario 64- I just want an excuse to see a giant penguin driving a go-kart, but technically it is a character in a Mario title.Duck Hunt Dog and Duck (complete with selectable color variants like Shy Guy and Yoshi)- They shared the same cartridge as Super Mario Bros. on NES- nuff said. It definitely makes more sense to me than including something as arbitrary and non-iconic as the Inklings.The Yellow Bunny from Mario 64- If you are going to continue to snub Pikachu and not include him in the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe roster, than please add this yellow rodent instead.Nabbit- Another great rabbit themed character worth having in the game.Dr. Mario, Fire Mario, Frog Mario, Raccoon Mario, Hammer Brother Mario, etc.WigglerBanjo/KazooieKing Bob-ombWingoDonkey Kong Jr.Diddy KongPichu/Pikachu/Raichu- the Pokémon could evolve after each lap or perhaps certain power-ups could temporarily evolve it. Maybe it just remains good ol’ Pikachu. Either way, a must have. Perhaps Pikachu gets a temporary Charizard outfit when he gets the fireball power-up. Maybe Pikachu de-evolves into Pichu when hit by lightning and evolves into Raichu when he gets the 3 mushroom boost or Bullet Bill power-up?Ash Ketchum- perhaps we see Pikachu and/or other Pokémon hanging on Ash’s shoulder or various animations of them popping out of his backpack or Pokéballs, doing cool Pokémon stuff. There is definitely potential for unique animations pertaining to Pikachu, Charmander, and Squirrtle when it comes to the lightening, fireball and shell attacks.Pac-Man- goes a bit faster than other characters as he collects coins, plus each coin gives him a slightly better speed boost than other characters for a very short amount of time. To balance this, his recovery time is the worst in the game if he gets hit with any weapon, and he gets knocked around very easily because of his extremely light weight class.Magikarp/Gyrados- begins as Magikarp with mediocre stats, but turns into Gyrados on the final lap with several stats maxed out like speed, weight, boost, and the best recovery time)Funky KongKing K. RoolKirbyMega ManMike Tyson- it makes a lot more sense than Animal Crossing and those dreaded Inkling characters. Technically Mario was in his game- he was the referee. Perfect tie-in😁","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EMJONF5I5RBB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"03/27/2020","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","Benjamin M. Weilert","Advancing the Mario Kart series with anti-gravity, other franchise inclusion, and gorgeous visuals.","Just like how Mario Kart 7 expanded on the core gameplay mechanic of the Mario Kart series by adding gliding and underwater features in its tracks, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe goes a step further and removes the confines of gravity from the franchise. This core change to the Mario Kart formula results in a lot of genuinely unique courses that couldn’t have been possible in previous games. To top everything off, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is presented in gorgeous high definition while also including all the downloadable content from the Wii U version at no additional cost.With a variety of new courses, as well as classic racetracks enhanced to the Switch’s advanced graphical capabilities, I was glad to finally see some representation in this franchise from characters outside the typical Mario franchise. Representative characters and courses from the Zelda, Animal Crossing, and Splatoon franchises felt like welcome additions and perhaps even the first steps toward making the Mario Kart franchise more in line with the celebration of video games that Super Smash Bros. Ultimate has become. Of course, the nostalgic tracks are pretty to look at but don’t hold any new secrets to discover in this iteration.Even if you need online access to play multiplayer across the internet, the Switch’s portability and a multitude of controller options make Mario Kart 8 Deluxe an easy game to bring with you anywhere you go and set up a multiplayer race on a moment’s notice. And while there are tons of characters, karts, wheels, and gliders to choose from, there isn’t much incentive to explore the other options in this game other than when a friend picks the character you usually play as and you’ll have to find someone new on the spur of the moment.Advancing the Mario Kart series with anti-gravity, other franchise inclusion, and gorgeous visuals, I give Mario Kart 8 Deluxe 4.0 stars out of 5.","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C9MIRWYFQZF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"03/09/2020","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Christopher Greffin","Best Mario Kart Game Ever","Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for the Nintendo Switch is certainly not a revolution for the mega-popular Nintendo series. Anyone who has played Mario Kart 8 on the Wii-U (you’ll be forgiven if you never bought that Nintendo system) will be on extremely familiar terrain (pun intended) with Deluxe. But with a few certain enhancements, and all of the extra DLC of MK8 available for free right from the start, this is the ultimate version of what is arguably the best—and certainly the most expansive and technically impressive—Mario Kart game ever. In my opinion it’s also the best online racing game I’ve ever played.In this game we have a bigger variety of tracks (a massive forty-eight in all), and racers (an expanded character roster from the already very diverse selection of Nintendo characters in MK8) than any previous entry in the series. Significantly, in MK8 Deluxe we have all the courses and racers unlocked from start (though you still must earn all the different carts, wheels, and parachutes—that allow you to alter the racer attributes—by completing the game’s modes and earning coins). Essentially the mechanics play like the Wii-U’s MK8, though one new upgrade here is the ability to hold two items at once, which in addition to making things a little more chaotic and fun adds a little bit of strategy to it. As in previous entries, going through the Grand Prix and time trials is a fun diversion (that is until you unlock the 200cc GP mode, which is very hard and really too fast for a Mario Kart game in my opinion, though some may enjoy such a challenge).But as solid as all the single-player modes of the game are, it’s the online multiplayer that’s where this game goes from a well-designed, fairly addictive racer, to being a frantic, super-fun, near masterpiece; from an enjoyable time to a potential obsession. This is not a first-time or even second-time feature in the series (which as early as 2005, with Mario Kart DS, had an online mode, and a good one which remember playing the hell out of), but on this game it comes with more polish, more variety, and yes, more fun, than any Mario Kart title of the past. In addition to everything all the game's modes come in glorious 1080P visuals, definitely improving on its predecessor, and has the crispest soundtrack in the series' history.If you’ve previously bought this game on the Wii-U—whose online play hasn’t been available for a while now so wouldn’t be much worth returning to—I would say it’s well worth shelling out for this version for fans of Mario Kart. And if you haven’t played MK7 then this game, that’s packed full of great content that will be fresh to you, with tons of replay value, is obviously one you must buy. One of the best racing games I have ever played.","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19AENE99FWK45/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"01/15/2020","United States 🇺🇸 ","3","Nathan W.","Solid game, great visuals, but they left the training wheels on","This version of Mario Cart has great visuals and I liked all the new toys and power-ups(my last version was on the Wii). I also thought gliding off jumps was a fun new addition to the series. That being said, when I play this version of the game it just doesn't feel right. In older versions you could explore the edge of the map, and if you went the wrong way you ended up paying the price. This game feels like they left the training wheels on. When you get close to the edge of the track the game takes over control of your vehicle and points you back in the right direction. As it does this even before you leave the main track at times it leaves you feeling like you're not really in control.  For young kids this probably makes the game less frustrating, but for me I felt like I was bowling with the gutter guards on.  I wish this was an optional setting so my young boys could use it while I was free to succeed(or fail) on my own.Hopefully I don't have to wait for the next Nintendo system for a better version of this game.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UPLU0XTSHZB7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","2","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

The courses are diverse and visually stunning, which make them fun the first few times you try them. But there is NO challenge whatsoever. There are four different rainbow roads and I couldn't fall off of them when I TRIED to. The camera and course automatically moves you around obstacles so you could probably just hold down the A button and you'd still beat half the NPCs.On the other hand, if you want a game that your five year old and fifteen year old can play together, this is ideal. It levels the playing field across age ranges because you can't use strategy with your item throwing to screw over other players.Overall, if you are an older player or enjoyed the challenge in Gamecube-era games, you will be bored with this game after two or so playthroughs of each level.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2LP2ORXHN03AD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","4","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

A little challenge and unlocking helps a long way. Also, with that many characters, some feel forgettable.Do not get me wrong - these are simply factors that I believe could provide an even better experience. Mario Kart at its finest.

"12/04/2019","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","Nathan",""Fun for everyone"","It's really fun if you know what settings to mess with, but if you want to get three stars on all the grand prix races then be prepared to smash your switch into the wall. The normal grand prix races are terrible, because they mixed far too many different elements in at the same time, and the items cause the most skilled players to end up in 5th or 6th on a good day. The more powerful items are impossible to use without flying off the course, and the items you get when in the lead are pathetic. On multiple occasions I've been in first place for all three laps on the hardest difficulty with the hardest cpus, and three seconds before I cross the finish line I'm hit with a blue shell, red shell, bomb, you name it, and I end up with a little Nice Try! message. The items are a balancing method to make the game fun for everyone when really it just throws any of your skill out the window. Also the items do not work with the courses, especially on 150 or 200cc, because the courses are much more complex and difficult to maneuver, and most of the items give speed boosts, which are entirely too fast for the course. I've played Mario Kart for nearly ten years, and it's disappointing that I can't absolutely demolish my friends at it like any other Mario Kart. So if you're like me and want to hone your skills on the new courses, just do VS and turn off the items.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11O0RI4YB8BY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","1","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"10/22/2019","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","J. Boyd Jr","Fun for the family, but not the same as the past.","I admit, I mainly bought this game for the nostalgia of Mario kart from n64. While the game does have that similar feeling it just isn't the same.I have three issues really with this game. The first is the scoring system. The second is the track limits. Third, the squid item. With that being said let me explain.Issue one, the scoring system.  In n64 Mario kart the scoring system was simply your position of finishing.  However, in this game it goes more than that. The bulk of your points are made from combat triggering items etc. The position you get just gives you a bonus in points. So what is my issue? Well, even if you finish in first, others playing with you may get a higher score due to them nailing people constantly with shells.Second issue, map limitations. One of the best things from older Mario kart games was when you knocked your opponent off the track. Mainly in corners. However, in this game you cannot be ran off the track. In fact, you cannot knock someone off the track and forced to be rescued except when you nail them with a shell while they are gliding in certain spots.Third issue, the squid ability/item. If you played previous Mario karts you probably remember the dredded moments when you take a turn only to have your screen blocked by black ink due to another player squidding you.  It was devastating in other versions. However in this version the ink is a joke. Enough of the screen is still visible that in most cases it doesn't effect you. However, another contributing aspect to it not being an issue is my issue mentioned above with not being able to drive off the edge.To sum up, the game will be a blast from the past and fun for the family. However it simply lost its racing aspect and not more focuses on the player interactions with each other.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3W0GMSM8M3S2H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","1","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

I played on wii all the time. Anyways, I got the game and like most of the tracks, however, it’s very redundant and weak at the same time. I don’t like the fact that I don’t press my own gas, I can’t go in patches of grass or “cheese” because it blocks me from being able to go anywhere but on the track. Unlike the older versions. I felt babied throughout the races and how you can’t even fall off the side ledges of the tracks either!! It’s autopilot!!! It even turns me away from ramps half the time. I do love the animal crossing track though. I wish maple treeway was on it though too","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG2C94NH0J4LL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"08/06/2019","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","NinjaDuck","Good value - a few negatives","These ladders create flexible options.  As you can see from my picture I actually used them on a trailer instead of a truck in order to make a kayak rack.Overall they are solid and sturdy.  As a few others have noted, the finish on several pieces came flawed.  The paint coat on them is easily scratched and they come pretty loosely packed in the box.The only other negative I would give them is that the 3/8 hex bolts that it comes with are only slightly larger than the holes in the ladder.  This does not give me a warm fuzzy feeling.  I would have preferred the heads to be slightly larger.  I will likely replace them with my own bolts.You will need your own 3/8 drill bit at 3/8 hex wrench to install.  The total install look my about 35 minutes including setup and drilling.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91H5+AmTBrL._SY1600.jpg","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4F67158MTDO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","1","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"07/28/2019","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","Amazon Customer","A great Mario Kart game, especially for two players","At this point, the Mario Kart experience is something that most gamers are familiar with. The game is a ton of fun, requires a surprising amount of skill to succeed consistently, and packs a number of online features that are beyond the norm for Nintendo's library of games.The only thing I wish was different is the framerate for when more than two players are racing on split-screen; this is a game that is simply more fun in 60 fps, and it is capped at 30fps with three or more players. The hardware limitations are understandable, but I have a feeling that many players would have rather seen Nintendo explore a cut in resolution or graphics quality before cutting frames.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35IHVJ1N9TMQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

Well it doesn't keep you playing everything is unlocked all plays and maps and modes.. So what's the point in grinding? Oh! That's right to unlock all car parts!!! Nah that's boring they pretty much do the same you have three different types not much really changes in the car, tires, shoot so once you got a couple unlocked you tend to stick to what you know. They also start you out in I'm handicap mode and all I can do is hit go. You can literally compete with friends doing nothing but pressing go and using items the only time it doesn't really work is when it's 200cc. I wish it had some grinding to unlock stuff to make me want to play. I just played it because I was bored and it was my only game at first. Now it's collecting dust.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23WM37O3DGWZ9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","6","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

I have a 49 inch TV and playing with more than three players makes the task of viewing the track a pain.The only problem with this game is when you're at first, after a really hard race, you're at the final lap, inches away from the finish line, then someone throws a red shell at you and you end up on 4th or worse... this will lead to a heart attack someday, pretty sure of it.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16SI5IZS5NKYV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"05/13/2019","United States 🇺🇸 ","1","James","Disappointing","This game is super disappointing compared to the gamecube version. The lack of user options and bad design makes it not worth buying. Examples include if you're ever in first or second place in a race, you'll never get any decent powerups. You'll generally be stuck with coins or bananas. You can't hit people to knock them off course and the jump feature is more like a miniature hop that doesn't matter at all. You can't selectwhich powerups are allowed in races or how many cpu ai's there are. This also goes for the battle mode. When playing balloons battle, you can't ram people to steal ballons. In fact, this game doesn't even have an in game settings page.

"03/04/2019","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","Spirit","It's Mario kart 8 but for the switch with better features","I would recommend it because of the online multiplayer online, but this time you have to pay a membership fee. Unlike Wii U players. The community is bigger on the Nintendo switch, so that means more online gaming matches. If you only care about single player content, and local multiplayer. Stick with the wii u version, because I would wait for a price drop. But Nintendo, won't really let that happen. I never owned Mario Kart 8 back when it released, so this is a necessary purchase for me, but I do feel for people who have already bought the game on the Wii U. I assure you though, that even if you buy the game a 2nd time. You will enjoy it.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BDRBINBXWGCV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"12/26/2018","United States 🇺🇸 ","2","Bob","Too Easy, too busy, too chaotic","After playing Mario Kart Wii for years and years and enjoying the challenge of unlocking courses and characters and karts, I was looking forward to the new version of the game on the Nintendo Switch (we skipped the Wii U).  Kind of disappointed.  There's seemingly little challengs, and most everything (tracks, characters, courses) is available right off the bat.  You don't even have to push the 'gas pedal' anymore!  You can literally set the control down and finish the race by letting it drive itself, and you may even finish in a good position.  They tried too hard with the tracks to make them 'exciting'...instead some of them are just garish and chaotic and dizzying.  MORE MORE MORE doesn't always mean a better game, and that's what happened here.  It seems aimed at 5 year olds who always want to be a winner.  If nothing else they should have put in more controls over the game parameters to make it even a little more challenging like the old Wii version which was vastly superior.  If you want the numb sugar coated version, set it to that.  If you want a game with a little challenge, set it to old school rules.  If you loved Mario Kart Wii, this game will probably disappoint you and seem way to easy.  If you never played that version before, then this one will proably just fine for you.","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2W2ROACPJ02WK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"11/04/2018","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","Bryan","This is a Wii-U Port","This game, while an improvement, is quite literally a Wii-U port. Many will simply shove this off as Mario Kart itself is simply a continued resurrection of the same core gameplay. However, this game is notably a copy/paste of Mario Kart 8 on the Wii-U that they didn't even bother to change the name enough. They actually fixed the battle mode, fixed the item system during matches, and offered all DLC in lump-sum purchase. The game itself is a better rendition this time with HD quality within the game but a lot of things are still amiss. For example, the coin item is still in the game, item distribution by default in online is still wacky, kart mechanics are not traditional, etc. Overall, this game is what you'd expect from a true Mario Kart game but we shouldn't have had to buy a Switch just to get it, PERIOD.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KQA700JFZ2NW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

It's much slower and doesn't respond half the time or more. The only saving grace of me keeping this was the Link free update and some remastered tracks.

"09/04/2018","United States 🇺🇸 ","1","Katie","You will win, and the whole time you are... you will  be hit without any hope of getting fair items.","Pro: Visually stunning... which, in 2018 is like saying air is awesome because you can breathe it.Cons/Facts: After all these years the gameplay is still weak. The only enjoyment to be had is if you have human friends to play with. Nintendo is incapable of providing a truly competitive CPU opponent, and so results to the usual cheap cheat tactics to cause you to lose. Double item slots are pointless when you will only recieve bananas, coins, and a rare shell if you are in first place against CPU. Literally across all the cups and every CC category, you will be bombarded with everything but the kitchen sink, and you will not recieve equal distro of items. This doesn't make the game more interesting or challenging... just annoying. I have had, on many occasions a half lap lead on CPU and their red shells seek you without inhibition. I threw a red shell at a CPU and it just missed, never turned to follow the CPU at all. I've still got triple star completions on every cup; it just isn't competitive. And again, totally pointless to have 2 item slots uou are in the lead your two items are most likely to be two coins... just pathetic. All the HD 3D environments cant fix weak game dynamics. They may as well just disable the controller anytime you start leading. What a waste of what could have been a great game. Wouldn't buy or recommend.","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WW7V1S35HAYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","2","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"08/29/2018","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","Svikelt","Thrilling game to own for the Switch, and incredible to play locally","This is a solid game to own on the switch, especially if you enjoy multiplayer hang outs, and for the Mario Kart franchise. I've been playing Mario Kart since the Nintendo 64, and I love the direction they went with this addition. The deluxe has all previously included and dlc characters and stages initially unlocked, which was a surprising amount of content, but I was slightly disappointed that there was not any progression to unlock them periodically. The game itself is very enjoyable and has a very high replayablity value. Playing on one joy-con and giving the other to a friend while playing outside was still loads of fun, but a little straining when you start to add 3 or 4 players to the tablet-sized screen. The graphics on the game were better than I had ever expected, especially while docked onto a 1080p TV. The price should be more reasonable and set to $50 at most, but overall a solid game.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YDXGSW3MIF0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

Worth the rebuy if you like mario kart","At first I was annoyed that nintendo wasn't offering any sort of compensation for wii U owners of mario kart 8 and especially those who bought the dlc but honestly the game is just fun all around. If you didn't get mario kart 8 on the wii u,  I 100% recommend this game on the switch. On the other hand, if you already own the original version of this game, You really need to think for yourself about whether or not you are going to spend more time playing this game on the new console.

"07/13/2018","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","Brad Davidson","It’s not without its glitches.","This is a solid entry into the ninetendo switch offering list. However, there are a couple glitches. First, the pause menu came up unprompted on multiple occasions. This gave me the feeling that try as I may to beat the game, it was somewhat out of my hands. This brings me to the next point: “winning” the game is both too easy to do and too confusing to do so quickly. I spent about 10 hours  at 150cc Grand Prix mode. Up until hour 8 I phoned in my playing because I wasn’t sure I was involved in a challenge. Then, things started getting hard and I tried and won.  Anyway, this will be a hugely popular game, but it’s. It without its glitches.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RNENUJYH7GELY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"07/11/2018","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","Esteban","One Of The Many Reasons Nintendo Hooked Me Back Into Video Games!","One of the main reasons I purchased a Nintendo Switch aside from it's hybrid functionality is it's ease of playing with others and enjoying a variety of game experiences. Mario Kart offers such awesome experience that it's perfect for a married couple. My wife and I constantly play together when we can and truly have fun! The game itself is very colorful and runs smoothly no matter how you decide to play. It's easy to pick-up and play for newcomers or people that are not into video games yet it also offers challenging modes for veterans of the series.My only 2 gripes for the game itself is the character roster as well as unlockables or lack there of. The roster is comprised of some familiar faces but I wish there was more variety. It feels as if the koopa characters and other costume/baby variants of characters are fillers. It would have been nice to see characters from other franchises similar to super smash bros. That brings me into the second point which is the absence of unlockables. From the start all the characters and courses are available to you. The only items you are able to unlock are parts to customize your ride but I wish other forms of rewards were introduced such as more characters, courses, and an achievement list.Despite the two drawbacks of the game this is the definitive edition and it does not take away from the overall experience of having a great time playing with other people. It is easily a must own game the defines what the Nintendo Switch is all about!","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XF67GDDKMCWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","37","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

I’ve beaten the game rather quickly and unlocked everything besides the gold tires which require beating Nintendo Ghost time trials. 200cc is hard but I recommend that one first before 150cc mirror mode. Once you go from 200cc to 150cc, 150cc seems slow and so much easier by then.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GDFJ5ICCY568/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"05/02/2018","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","cwk","Solid version","I've played a lot of Mario Kart over the years and this is probably my second favorite behind the DS version. Starting with the Wii version they added gimmicks (like zero gravity and underwater) that don't really enhance the game in my view, and the courses got a little softer and less exciting (compare Bowser's Castle and Luigi's Mansion to the DS versions). The drifting mechanic is good and the countless kart / wheel combinations can make a big difference in handling. I find it's best to stick to one thing for a while. I like the coin system. The items are a bit too familiar to me at this point.I don't think Nintendo can do much more to improve on this game. Hopefully any follow-up will be a dramatic departure from the current formula.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LF2L5AN90431/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

The first is a  guidance system to keep the Kart on the course. You'll know this is  enabled when you have  and antenna with a blinking light on the back of your kart.  The second is a steering option.  You can either use the joystick on the controller to steer the kart or  use the controller like a steering wheel.  And the third is an acceleration assistance.  You can use all or none of these options in any configuration you choose.  Also, if you have two pairs of joy con controllers up to four players can play.

Whether you have friends to enjoy this game with you or not, there is plenty to do in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Everything that made the Wii U original game great is present here (as it is a boosted port) and the amount of content and gameplay is sure to have you coming back time and time again. Paired with the easy accessibility of the Switch and the simple controls, this game is a perfect fit for the casual or hardcore gamer, and potentially the most accessible and fun the Mario Kart series has ever been. My favorite feature personally has been the worldwide online races, where 12 people from all around the globe race against one another on tracks voted on by the players. Not to mention the various other modes to keep you entertained both offline and online. If you're looking for games to add to your Switch collection or picking one up for the first  time, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is an amazing game through and through.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LQGS9IA4MDPJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","6","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

Takes away from the progress aspect a little. Other than that, this game is fantastic. My brother and I play all the time, it never gets boring since there are so many maps and game modes. Played it at first without wheels, it's easier that way, the wheels are a lot more fun though, so I definitely recommend getting some to go with it.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EAGSPOVRPY72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","1","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"03/18/2018","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","Merklynn","Recommended, for now","I am not really into racing games but mario kart is amazing fun, I love it.  Graphics are great, loads of stuff happening all over the place, races are fun, lots to do, loads of tracks/ vehicles/ game modes, easy to pick up and put down when you fancy ago, you don't have to spend hours in front of it but if you want to you will enjoy it.  It isn't a new game though, rather a re-release of the wii u version with improvements, not  a problem for me as I don't have one but if I already had it on that then I would think twice about buying as these games aren't cheap, though their price does fluctuate a lot, you can generally find them somewhere cheaper.  There are lots of multiplayer options, race online and all that which is great..... until September when Nintendo go the same way as the other console manufactures and start raking in a monthly fee which is annoying, specially as the longevity of this game is gonna be based on competition.  Lose a star for that (for now, maybe more when September hits).","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ2CC25ETA5E2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

Skill is replaced with luck so the game is a roll of the dice.  You can powerslide around every corner perfectly and hit every jump boost but the way the power ups are distributed you'll end up getting clapped over and over again. Yes you can win the occasional online game but the feeling is shallow knowing you were mostly lucky. The tactics of holding onto a green shell or banana for defense is longer viable with the amount of ghost power ups used in race.  I wish they'd just make a remake of the original with updated graphics and additional courses with the same balance.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16PQPGXTBB13E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","3","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

While it had the problem of the computer getting super human speed every time it was behind, it didn't detract from the races too much.Fast forward to 8 on the switch and the tracks remind me of F-Zero, which i think is pretty cool. I like the driving dynamics and how you have to use your brakes on 200cc to avoid hitting the walls, however, the use of items by the cpu characters gets really annoying. The blue shells, lightning, and ink blots occur almost in every lap. This becomes a nuisance after a while as the game seems to rely heavily on the use of items. In the N64 version, you were lucky if you got one of these gamechanger items per race. Also, getting a coin as an item is kinda lame.Conclusion: it's definitly fun but the item use may get annoying","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FWNL39R0B3D7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

All characters are unlocked already which stinks and no Diddy Kong or Birdo anymore. Reason it got 4 stars is because lack of creativity on Nintendo with bringing the same game from Wii U to the Switch, but I never owned a Wii U because it's the same as Wii.

The graphics have improved significantly over Mario Kart 7. All content is available from the beginning, which is great and terrible at the same time. The potential to unlock characters was a big part of the game for me, and I miss that from this release. You can unlock one character, Gold Mario which replaces Metal Mario but that is it.There's a wide variety of maps available, most of them are stunning and very fun to play. I'm disappointed with Battle mode, there is only a very small collection of maps available, and some are absolutely broken on certain mini-games like Renegade Round-Up where a match might last 19 seconds, even when playing against easy AI players just because they're so small and there aren't that many places to run around to.In Summary; Bring back the ability to unlock more than one character, and fix the major issues with your mini game offerings and it's perfect.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39PIE1X9OZSD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

Stop Reading, Buy it NOW!","This game is part of what I call the tri-force of Switch games that are required for ownership:1. Mario Odyssey2. Zelda Breath of the Wild3. Mario Kart 8 DeluxeSo far, out of the three games I have played, Mario Kart is the best.  Even as a remaster with DLC.  This game is perfectly optimized for the Switch. 60 FPS ALWAYS.  No dips.  When you go mobile, the game is extremely kind on the battery and last surprisingly long.Now lets get to the game:Tracks are a mix of old and new, and each track has unique hooks or features that don't make them seem stale.  Not to mention they are beautifully designed.  Plenty of characters to choose from, and an obscene amount of customization you can do to your go kart before the action begins.  Gameplay is fast, furious, and fun.The online mode is flawless in latency, and is always a joy to play.  What is the best is bringing someone who is playing in person with you online as well.This has been the only Mario Kart I have played since N64.  Just an amazing experience, please stop reading this and buy it now.","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HHA78U5U5WMF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"01/06/2018","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Tyler Jacobson","A great game that's fun for all ages!","Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is pretty much essential if your Nintendo Switch players are too young for Breath of the Wild or anything that's too sophisticated for young gamers.That's not to say it's overly simplistic, but it is a very easy game to pick up and just play.  You can choose among a slew of familiar characters, karts, and kart designs and accessories that you unlock as you play.  There are also a few updated versions of tracks from previous Mario Kart games.  The tracks are unique, varied, and provide just enough challenge.Speaking of challenge, you can start out racing at the 50cc engine class for beginners and younger players who are just starting out.  For more advanced players, with a higher skill level, the engine classes go up to 200cc, where the races are faster, more difficult, and require more drifting to be successful.There are also multi-player battle and vs modes so the whole gang can play.Overall just a fun game for all ages, and pretty much essential for Switch owners with kids.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BmB6GoDKL._SY1600.jpg","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20PEFGGT5N5VB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","1","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"12/27/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Ginger Aille","Great Game, TONS of content, endless family-friendly fun","Santa dropped this game along with a new Nintendo Switch just 2 days ago. So far, this game is our #1 pick to play as a family.MK8D is far and away the best of Mario Kart games that I've played (and I've played most).  Many kart options, many drivers to choose, options for wheels, gliders, etc.  You can mix and match to find a combination that suits your driving style and personality.  There are 12 cups with 4 courses in each one (48 different tracks!), 5 different speeds (50cc, 100cc, 150cc, 150cc mirror, 200cc).  Many of the tracks are brand spanking new, which is awesome, but for fans of old school Mario Kart there are throwbacks to SNES, GameBoy Advance, N64, GameCube, and Wii tracks that give a sense of nostalgia, but they are refreshed for a new console with great graphics and gameplay.We haven't explored the battle modes or online play yet (just setting up new Nintendo Accts today), but we are looking forward to it!This is played with the individual joy cons so 2 can play with one set.  Either tilt steering or using the thumbstick.  We have also used controller wheels (sold separately, Amazon Basics) and *I* find them comfortable and easy to use, but others in my family prefer to hold the joycon on its own.One thing to note is that there is a new feature - Smart Steering - which helps users stay on the course instead of flying off into oblivion.  This is ON by default which is good for younger players and older players (like me) who tend to fly off the edge on courses like Rainbow Road, but it can be turned off easily in-game (during cart customization and again during the race).","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3J6SYKZU7MXWZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"12/27/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","Jordan","Mario Kart 8 Deluxe leaves the Wii U version in the dust.","Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is an enhanced port of Mario Kart 8 , which was released for the not-so-great Wii U console. What's new in this version of Mario Kart 8 is the much-requested traditional Battle Mode. And Nintendo didn't stop there. We got not one-not two- but 5 different battle modes that do a splendid job in changing up the gameplay. The improved battle modes alone made me wan to purchase this game. If you want to know how each new battle mode works, then you'll have go to the official website, but I have to carry on with the review.The next new aspect of this deluxe version are 4  brand new racers, which is always a good thing. No problem here.Moving on, there is the inclusion of double-item boxes, which allow for two items to be held at the same time. If you weren't aware, the Wii U's Mario Kart 8 only allowed you to carry one item during a race, which meant after someone knocked your defensive item off or you get a lousy item such as a coin, then you were exposed to other racer's attacks. Now, we can have one item in the front slot for defense and the other in the second slot for a surprise attack. This addition was brilliant and makes gameplay all the better.We're not done yet, guys. This version also gives you EVERY BIT OF DLC that was costed money on Wii U. Now, it's free and it's included in this version as a part of the $60 package. This DLC includes 16 new racetracks and a few new racers (some of which are clones, but oh well).Lastly, small tweaks to gameplay were implemented in this Deluxe version. First, we have smart steering, which is PERFECT for beginners. Let's say little Suzie wants to play Mario Kart with her big brother Chad, just turn on smart steering and the game won't let her steer off course and fall to her demise. Next is a new drifting technique called the ultra mini turbo. This is more for advanced players but it's still a welcomed addition. All of the other additions are changes to gameplay balancing, so I won't mention them here.The verdict: So, you're probably wondering why I did nothing but praise this game, yet there's still one blank star on my rating. The reason is simple. MOST OF THESE FEATURES SHOULD'VE BEEN IN THE ORIGINAL GAME. Early adopters of the Wii U version, such as myself, were baffled as to why some of these features (that were standard in a Mario Kart game) were absent from the Wii U version. It's like they intentionally gave Wii U owners a watered-down game just to release this version. So, do I think this game is worth 60 bucks? Yes, if you've never bought a Wii U and are looking for a fun family game with TONS of replay value. But, If you already have the original Mario Kart 8...I really can't say. I bought this version because I needed some games to play on my new Switch. But, I can't imagine everyone else is ok with spending 60 more bucks on features you should've already been able to play PLUS DLC you've already bought. Just going to be honest, Nintendo did the Wii U owners dirty. Anyway, I hope my review helped you out. Happy gaming.","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXD53YW2S1WW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"12/25/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Willie G.R.","A masterpiece revived with sharper graphics and a perfected vs mode.","I will start by stating that, even tho the upgrades on graphics were minimal, they have made this already beautiful game into a masterpiece of vibrant colors and textures.  There are also the new items, characters, and the upgraded versus mode that truly make this game into what it should have truly been on WiiU.  That said, I still think Nintendo should have priced it at least 10 dollars less, as this game is still the same as the one on WiiU.  This is just my opinion in the matter, however, and I still think the game is worth purchasing, especially for those playing it for the first time.  Unlike the WiiU version, all race tracks and modes are already unlocked, and unlocking new vehicles has become easier, but trust me when I say you will still love this Mario Kart game to no ends.  One more note I would like to add is how much easier it is to play as 2 players, now that the Joy Cons come in pairs that can be used by two players at once.","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3JJOV8WB081HJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"12/20/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","Logic","Great cart racer but needs tweaking","The game is fun, looks awesome, controls are awesome, its Mario Cart! My only complaint is the frequency of items during races. You can be the best cart racer in the world and still lose!!! One minute you're in 1st place perfectly drifting making Zero mistakes. Then bam you get hit by a blue shell, then another blue shell, then maybe a couple of red shells all in a row! You go from 1st, all the way to 5th even 10th all because of things out of your control. The better you race the worst items you get from randomized weapon boxes, meanwhile people in dead last are pumbling you with Shells and other items. I wish there was a game mode where Items weren't aloud aside from custom matches. The items make this game unplayable for me, I can't be competitive in a game that screws you for playing well. Seriously.......... what were they thinking with the items? I returned it I'll wait for the next Mario Cart that's more balanced because the weapon/item balancing in this game is atrocious and broken in my opinion. This isn't an exaggeration, go ahead and get it if you don't care about losing because of things that are out of your control.

"12/09/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","CaptainK","Love","Mario Kart is always a classic that I love. Fell in love with the original Wii version and this one is much better. Some of the maps you'll recognize but many have new twists and there are new maps to race. I love the battle games as well. (Balloon Battle is my personal favorite) Switching to two or more player mode is easy. (When you first try two player, for some reason the settings will be all turned on such as the safer driving mode, so drifts don't work as well, and the players kart will always be hitting the gas, and in battle mode that's not convenient so make sure you turn those settings off). And online playing is a welcome addition. You can choose between regional and world. There isn't a 'Grand Prix' in the online racing, just one race at a time. And playing Battle online, there's just one round at a time, no 4 rounds and then a winner is decided. Also there's no picking which battle game you want to play, it just cycles through the five. At first I didn't like it but it forced me to get better at games I didn't really play often. In the online playing there is a personal point system. You start out with 1,000 points and depending how you rank each round, you can either earn or lose points. (Got down to 988 and back up to 1250). While the console comes with two controllers, I find myself considering buying another set because I don't like the feel of playing with one controller, as it's so small. Also I keep tilt controls off cause I find it makes me lose control. All in all, a main staple to my gaming life.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZCX56FW77H3X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","6","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"11/18/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","3","chess & checkers","Great if you don't own Mario Kart 8 on Wii U, otherwise not worth the price.","Well, this game suffers from re-release syndrome in my opinion. There's simply not enough new stuff to make it significantly better than the Wii U version. No new tracks, a couple new characters, some improvement to visuals and a few Battle Mode innovations. The only game changer is the ability to carry two items, and by extension, double item boxes. The problem is that the game becomes even more chaotic, over-the-top chaotic in my opinion. I used to eat 0-1 Blue Shells every race in 8, rarely ever 2, but in Deluxe, be ready to consistently be on the receiving end of 2-3 Blue Shells and/or 2-3 bolts of Lightning every race. Oh, and Blue Shells now have a high trajectory, so they don't hit anyone except the leader, making them even less useful for the racer throwing it and being more annoying for the leader. The game punishes you even harder for leading, which makes the main flaw of the Mario Kart series more annoying. I'm sorry, but if the main changes in the game make it worse, you can't expect more than three stars.So is the game bad? No, not by a longshot. It's great fun for adults, kids, parties, nostalgia and more. However, if you own the Wii U version with the DLC and are on a budget (Switch games are really expensive), you can safely skip Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. If you only have 8 on Wii U without DLC, I would still recommend just buying the DLC. However, if you don't have the Wii U version, it's a great buy.","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWPAINJ5VIXQN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","3","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

It's fine and fun for all ages (with a bit of practice for newcomers), especially due to its new-player-friendly functions.Pros1. The graphics are beautiful. Pay attention to the detail of the course itself and everything outside the course (especially Baby Park and Ribbon Road).2. The new Smart Steering function keeps players from driving off-course, so that's why it's so great for new players (no idea why they didn't think of this before).3. New Battle Modes make the game even more epic. I have hardly ever had fun with Mario Kart Battle Modes until now. There are new courses and new modes.4. the new characters add more color to the game, especially since Bowser Jr. is my favorite character.Cons1. There are no new racing courses, which aggravates me.2. It's not the best single-player game out there. Fortunately, you can play online. Coming across bad words in Mii names (since none can be used in comments) is rare.Tips: Use Smart Steering on 200 CC. It helps. A lot.Overall, this game is awesome for any family or racer.

If you are a big fan and/or you play the switch on the go allot, I would recommend this game, otherwise the wii u version should suffice.I have been a fan of the Mario Kart series but the biggest issue I've always had was the rubberband AI and victory was based on the items you got. When I first played this on the Wii U I was amazed by the controls. This game is more skill based than the previous games. I love old Mario Kart for nostalgia, but they havent aged well. The effects of items like red and blue shells have been reduced and the players behind you do not have that rubberband AI, so the hard work you put in to stay in first place pays off. There is still some luck involved, but that is part of what makes this game fun. The battle mode in the deluxe version has improved greatly. I can spend hours online playing battle mode. If there are some things that I can say i do not like is the way they have control option set up. It is very easy to turn an option on in the pause menu that you didn't intend to turn on. Also there aren't many unlockables which makes time trials less of an incentive to play.","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PHHM37WWNB99/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

With that being said I do believe it’s missing something. I love the gameplay for battle mode and the races are definitely fun and its awesome that they have expanded the carts and the characters you can play with so now you have way more options of racers and carts. That being said, I think they should have 4x the levels on the game. This is a $60 game and half of the tracks are just a regurgitated version of the previous games. The nostalgia is cool and all but I believe there should be all of the retro levels and a bunch of new ones included with this title. Also there are only 4 or 5 levels that you can play in battle mode. I love this game and its been a blast but I think you can play all there is to play in one day. Given the fact that Xbox and PlayStation are releasing their new games at the same cost, there should be way more bang for the buck on this game rather than just a nostalgia factor.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSU8W17D3K13O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","2","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

There are some new characters and vehicles like the inklings and the splat buggy.The big deal with this Switch version of MK8 is more dynamic gameplay  with double item boxes that can put you in the lead almost instantly if you're lucky.The 200cc tracks are slightly easier here than in Wii U's MK8 which is good because they'll come up as options when you play live.

You could not hold two f****** items. That has been a huge part of strategy in the last mario kart games. Constantly getting a coin in first only to have a red or green shell hit you gets annoying. This allows for having a defense as well as planning ahead on when to use your items. Makes the whole game more intense and strategic. The addition of the super boost from drifting is welcome although you barely can use it as it takes a lot of turning. The battle mode is also pretty cool addition. If I knew more people with the system i think it'd be more fun but I usually still stick to just plain racing. The worse part of the port, which is terrible on Nintendo's part, is the fact that they couldn't add a few more tracks. The tracks are WAY to short to begin with. would have been nice to have an additional minute or 2 of racing because it ends too fast. So that would have been nice. Also, they have to figure out this online voice chat. It's 2017and if a company worth a few billion dollars can't implement this then who knows.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R214FWDV7ZK5H5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","4","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"10/09/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","Jimbob64","Fun party game- grab a friend and go nuts!","Purchased it yesterday for play with my girlfriend, since our existing plans fell through. She and I both used to play (different versions of) Mario Kart in the past but neither of us had picked up the game for a long time since.Like one would expect, we picked up the game and weren't very good at it in the beginning, though everything felt comfortable and familiar. As we played for the next few hours (which positively flew by), we brushed the rust off our skills and had just as much fun lapping the  CPUs in the various modes as we had laughing  at our own wipeouts earlier.Neither  of us had a problem with using a single  Joycon each, though I shouldn't like to think how using items or drifting would be  without the Joycon strappy things to give us proper shoulder buttons.Notes for new owners: Auto steering and auto accelerate (and tilt-to-steer) are on by default and the game doesn't tell you how to disable them unless you go looking. To turn these things off or on: Start a race, pause, and cleck the top corner/s of the screen, which show you which buttons toggle these features.Also, reviews who say there's practically nothing to unlock: That is only true of characters. Except Gold Mario (reskin of Metal, unlock by finishing all cups at 200cc), the whole roster is available from the start. All tracks seem to be available, and  that is actually more fun  for the two of us- we could race anywhere, from the start. Kart upgrades/options unlock every few races based on  how many coins you collect total, seemingly at random. There seems to be a satisfying amount to unlock in terms of parts, though I have yet to try much beyond Yoshi + standard everything, who plays exactly how I remember him as my best character.Not sure how much fun it'll be now that  she had  to fly home again, but if you have a second player (and preferably a TV), it's a blast.","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYILO0YZXLE6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

I do like the different routes you can take, but it seems like a 5 year old cartoon vs a skilled race. It's ok I suppose, but after 1 hour I don't plan to play it again. Best strategy I saw was stay 2nd or 3rd until almost the end, or you will be hit with 3 different items at once going from 1st to 8th in last few feet. Happened too many times to be coincidence. The AI needs work as it continuously cheats your skill. Controls need a bit of work too.

I had the Wii U version and already knew this is an amazing game. The fact that it has all the DLC included makes it an incredible deal. So many courses and if Nintendo made more DLC courses available for purchase I would buy them all in a heartbeat.The added steering assist option is great for kids and non-serious gamers. It helps them stay in the race and keeps then from feeling bad about their performance. Don't worry if you are a serious Mario Kart racer rest assure that the steering assist disable the purple drift boost and forces the kart to stay on the main path, which makes it hard to take advantage of shortcuts.My only very minor complaint is you cannot choose the battle mode to play; they cycle through the battle modes. Probably cause everyone only only play the balloon battle mode.

Since Mario Kart: Double Dash!Regardless, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the gem of all Mario Karts. From its graphics, elaborate levels and challenges, this game is great for those who play alone or with friends and family. Since I play alone, I have no judgment on the multiplayer aspect. However, my prediction is that it's nothing short of fantastic!All five modes are readily available: 50cc, 100cc, 150cc, Mirror Mode and 200cc. In some courses, especially on 150cc and 200cc, prepare for immense frustration, as the CPU will undoubtedly pummel you with an onslaught of items such as Red Shells, Green Shells, Blue Shells and Lightning. If you lose first place, it's very difficult trying to get it back; the CPU this time around are merciless. Unfortunately, for every console Mario Kart to date, I've always had to deal with the CPU's ruthless assaults. Especially if I'm in first place, which I usually keep. Advice: always try to have at least two items. One on the back of your kart and the other one for safe keeping.200cc is where the real challenge lies; not only must you be wary of your opponents and environment, but your driving skills should be nothing short of superb. Otherwise, it's off the track you go! Or at the very least you'll keep bumping into obstacles and going off road if your drifting and braking simultaneously is terrible.The soundtrack is very diverse and wonderful as well. I appreciate all of them, yet there are ones that are conspicuous more than others: Electrodrome, Rainbow Road, Bowser's Castle, Thwomp Ruins, Shy Guy Falls, Dolphin Shoals and Wild Woods. Beautiful compositions, as well as the overall environment.There are over a dozen characters to choose from. Some less original than others. I say that because those slots could have gone to other original characters that could have either made a first-time debut, or a return. Double Dash was the only Mario Kart where each character had a unique special. Unfortunately, these don't return in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.Different vehicles are prominent, each with different stats that could make or break a race for you: Traction, Handling, Weight, Acceleration and Speed are all the stats. Find the right balance. Unlockable vehicles, tires and paragliders will become available the more coins you collect.Overall, I love this game. This is my favorite Mario Kart to date; Double Dash's throne is now overthrown, placing second. I intend to keep playing.

The deluxe version has enough new features for me to justify getting it:- The graphics on this new version blow the Wii U version away. It's so much more crisp and vibrant. The higher frame rate also makes it look so much more smooth.- In my opinion, this is the perfect kind of game for a handheld experience. It's the kind of game where you can just pick up and stop playing as soon as you need to. So this will be game of choice when I take my Switch with me when I travel.- Other cool new features: new characters, all of the DLC included, steering assist, online play. The first two reasons above were enough for me to like this version, though.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DGJXNZ85ZQP5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","1","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

While I had played the game on the WU, I never purchased the system or the game and therefore was excited to be able to play it on my own system.  This game is really fun to play at parties, especially since you can just pull out the kickstand on the Switch and not have to worry about plugging it in to the TV.  I also like how you can turn on different handicaps such as assisted turning and acceleration to help new players be able to participate.I also found this to be more smooth and overall better made than the regular Wii version. While I did love the Wii version and think that one's awesome as well, I love all the different modes, ways to customize your car, and different tweaks you can do for new challenges.  It seemed in the Wii version you pretty much found a character/kart setup and never used anything else ever again.Overall, I've already played it a ton and love the game.

"08/21/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Jan","Fast-paced and exciting","Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a fast-paced and enjoyable game that works well for all ages, and its portability on the Switch makes it an easy choice. Though admittedly the game is more fun with more people, single-player itself had a lot to offer, and I found myself surprised by the number of things to do for a completionist like me.First, there's the Grand Prix mode, which rewards players with a satisfying trophy every time they place in either the first, second, or third places, motivating success for all players. Giving separate trophies for different speeds, including 50, 100, 150, and the new 200 cc, makes everyone feel like a winner, even beginners to the franchise. I enjoyed how easy it was for people of all experience levels to pick up the game, as most of my friends who do not play video games were easily able to start driving (granted, they did turn on smart steering).Next, there's the Time Trials, where you can race with virtually anyone else in the globe with the game without having to have them physically be there. The addition of the Staff records gave an additional challenge for more experienced players willing to take on the challenge. Also, playing all of these races and collecting coins unlocked a series of kart customization options. Coming from a player whose last Mario Kart game was on the Wii, I loved picking out and testing new kart, wheel, and glider combinations each time I played, so even if I played the same stages over and over, it still felt new and exciting.On to multiplayer though, it's pretty great to bring Mario Kart around and be able to play with multiple people without having to stay confined to 20 feet of the TV or by yourself on a 3DS. Though the screen gets a bit small and it's a little harder to see when another person joins, it's worth it for the hours of fun the game can provide.Though I didn't usually play battles on Mario Kart Wii, this game gave so much variety rather than the usual balloon battles and coin runners (though they were included) by adding three new modes, my personal favorite being Renegade Roundup, solely for the thrill of either perpetually having a piranha on my kart or running away from them. I was a tiny bit disappointed over the number of battle stages, as I expected more.Overall, the game's a great buy and is perfect for long plane rides (I speak from experience), fun with friends, or even just a normal day at home. Whether a casual gamer or somewhat intense, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe brings the perfect balance between fun and competition.","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1U67M2PMLGSU1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"08/20/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","1","John T","Cheap AI - unplayable","I've been a Mario Kart purist going back to the original, and these just keep getting worse. This game is no longer about skill, at all. Anything higher than 50 cc the AI will absolutely destroy you when you're in first. There's literally nothing that you can do, just constant weapons hitting you and since you're in front you can't fight back, but it never fails that you'll get passed at the end of the final lap, even if you had the perfect race. It's also suspicious that none of the circuit races are timed.  It's almost as if Nintendo wanted to hide the fact that it's pointless to try and beat your best time, which was a big part of the original.  They know the AI is awful and completely ruins the competition and fun.  But why?  Makes no sense for the game to be this way.  I don't know how people get into this. Maybe as a drunk party game where no cares if they win or even finish a race, but if you're seriously playing to win races the AI makes it nearly impossible, and again it never shows you what your lap time is. Hopefully soon the Angry Video Game Nerd rips this pile of junk to pieces.","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R164TSJ4VYOV5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","2","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"08/14/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","1","Cameron","Not as good as Wii U version","Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a switch port for the original Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U.I loved the original Wii U version. What's missing in the switch version is lack of new content. It's like the developers forgot to add these new battle modes and a few other characters because the new console just came out.There are 5 new characters, Squid Girl, Squid Boy, King Boo,  Bowser Jr, Dry Bones, and Gold Mario (which is just a skin of Metal Mario) but you have to unlock him by beating 200 CC with coming first at least in all cups.Doing this made the game very unenjoyable and then when I had Gold Mario I thought was all of that effort worth it? No it wasn't.Dry Bones, and Bowser Jr have been in Mario Kart games before so technically they shouldn't have been included as new characters for Deluxe.The inclusion of the Splatoon Inklings makes it seem like a pointless advertisement for Splatoon 2 rather than a well thought out exclusive Switch title.They had the best opportunity to make Mario Kart 9, which is what I would have preferred over this, but sadly they threw that opportunity out the window.If you already own the Wii U version and enjoyed that better, I suggest don't get the Switch version. It's pretty much the same with fewer differences. But you're still paying for full price which is highway robbery.","","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R329LHE9XNN01E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","5","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

I got this the day it released and have been having a blast since. This is the best version yet. It's great having all of the characters and tracks unlocked from the outset. The item distribution remains infuriating especially if you're leading the race, but that's part of the Mario Kart charm, I suppose. The AI difficulty really ramps up at 150-200cc, and totally amplifies item rage when you're inevitably targeted by blue or red shells in the last lap of a race. Additionally, online play has been fun, but not without occasional connectivity issues.

"07/31/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","J. Sullivan","Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is an Exhilarating Must Have Title","I absolutely love Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. It has plenty of exciting tracks from which to choose. Several different vehicles, wheels, and airfoils unlock as coin collection quotas are achieved throughout the races.I was looking for a game with intense action, and MK8D delivers with a diverse cast of Nintendo characters who will pelt your cart with shells, slip you up on banana peels, cast Bloopers to blind all the racers with a temporary ink screen, and utilise a few more clever little tricks to test your patience.A huge selection of tracks, combined with the different racing classes, and a mirror track circuit, opens up a wide range of racing at different skill levels.I find that getting three stars on all of the tracks is simple in the 50cc class. I skipped the 100cc class, and I jumped straight into the 150cc racers, providing a decent challenge in which I am still taking my time trying to get all of my three-star victories. I still have a heart pounding 200cc class to tackle when I'm ready.I really wanted to enjoy competing online, but some days are better than others in regard to being able to maintain a connection to the server.With each update, the graphics have been given more detail, and gameplay has improved, although I still get bumped out of the online races on occasion.Local multiplayer is a blast, but I could not imagine being able to do well on a split screen unless docked to be viewed through a full size television. Single player handheld is totally doable, though.I mostly play the four race circuits, but there are other modes that look quite fun.I love the weapons system. Two items may be in possession at any given time, the most recently acquired of which remains in reserve until the first weapon is spent. The 8 is a rare treat, which equips your kart with all eight weapons at once, their symbols circling your kart, and can be used in any order when selected when straight in front of your racer.I love my Switch, and I think Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a must have title with incredible replay value. It is wonderful to play on the go, and is an amazing game to knock a few races out at my convenience at home. It is fun, it looks spectacular, and shortcuts are scattered about, and can gain some distance if your risk is met with success.I highly recomm mario Kart 8 Deluxe! It is a masteriece of a game that is exciting for experienced gamers, and is equipped with helper options that can make kart racing more accessible to young players who may not be as good at staying on the road. I love everything about it, except for the inconsistent internet connectivity.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Y3ODXL6I7674/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","2","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

Each map is unique with great detail, the downhill slalom course is unique as there is no lap, but first one down the mountain.  The online features work quite well, a couple of hiccups here or there but overall very solid.

"07/17/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Craig Deming","The Switch treatment gives this great game the exposure it needs.","MARIO KART 8 DELUXE: REVIEWNINTENDO’S LATEST RACER GETS A TUNE-UP ON THE SWITCH Consider, if you will… I know a game that is played by adults and kids, nerds and jocks, and everyone in between. It is thrilling, heartbreaking, and stands as one of the fiercest stress tests of your friendships in existence. It stands to many as the ultimate contest, the final say in conflict resolution, the great equalizer. Friends, I have never seen a game bring people together like Mario Kart. It is the only game I have played both at college parties AND with my wife’s family (even my mother-in-law. Her Wario is vicious.) It is the only game I have seen self-described “non-gamers” pick up and enjoy that doesn’t involve aggressive birds or pieces of candy being smashed. Nintendo’s arcade kart racer has been around for a while now, and it’s latest iteration, Mario Kart 8, was an incredibly smooth, colorful and simply addictive experience on the Wii U. There was really just one problem with it. Okay, maybe two.1) The game’s battle mode was treated as an afterthought, where battles were fought on actual tracks as opposed to arenas, as in previous games. It made it damn near impossible to even FIND other players, forget being able to peg them with items as you zoom in opposite directions.2) The game carried the burden of being released on the Wii U, a console that vastly undersold compared to Nintendo’s original projections. It was a great game that was released on a platform that couldn’t give it the exposure it needed. Today, however, Nintendo’s newest console has far outpaced not just its predecessor in the Wii U but is on track to outsell the Wii, one of Nintendo’s highest selling consoles in industry history. Due to the much wider exposure provided by this higher install base, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe will see a much bigger audience compared to the original title on the Wii U. So for many, this will be a brand new gaming experience. But the real test will be for those of us who already owned, played and enjoyed the original title on the Wii U. Is this “Deluxe” edition worth paying for a second time? The short answer is yes. The slightly longer answer is that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the definitive version of the long-standing franchise. And the full answer follows here: The concept of Mario Kart is relatively simple. You pick a character and a kart and race against Mario and his candy-colored acquaintances of the Mushroom Kingdom across wild tracks while hurling items of various destructive powers at each other. Controlling your kart is an easy affair, with gas and brake each getting a button, while one shoulder button launches items and the other allows you to drift around corners and jump off of ramps and environmental bumps to catch some air and earn a small boost. But in Deluxe, the ability to tailor your controls gets an upgrade. Say you’re playing with a small kid that doesn’t quite understand game controls, or a significant other or friend that is only playing for social reasons. There is an option to activate “steering assist” for their character. This feature keeps the player from driving off the edge of the track. The trade-off is that steering assist prevents you from purposefully leaving the main track to take advantage of a shortcut, encouraging players using it to learn to steer and work the turns without the assist.  This feature can be turned on and off both while customizing your kart and by pausing a race. But driving, drifting and boosting isn’t all to consider when playing. Littered along the tracks are coins, which will increase your top speed as you collect them, and glowing rainbow-colored boxes that contain valuable items. These items range from banana peels that you can drop behind you to cause an opponent’s kart to slip and spin out, turtle shells of various colors that act as kart-to-kart missiles, mushrooms that give your kart a turbo boost, and some especially destructive items that can affect all racers, or even just the racer in first place. Yes, the dreaded blue shell makes its return, but fortunately players have one more option to avoid the normally devastating item. In addition to using a mushroom boost at the right moment, a new item called the Super Horn can destroy a blue shell while it circles your head. Item balance in general seems far less chaotic this time around, as even in the higher difficulties I very rarely ran into a situation where I felt my good driving was punished by rubber-banding AI. Don’t get me wrong, you will still get blown up with a red shell, blue shell or a Bullet Bill when closing in on the finish line on the last lap. But it happens with far less frequency when playing alone, so earning those gold cups in Grand Prix mode is a far less frustrating task. Those playing alone have a surprising number of options at their disposal, including the aforementioned Grand Prix mode, a regular Vs mode where you can choose races and tracks while competing against AI opponents, Time Trials where you can aim to beat the fastest times on courses, and even battle mode is available to single player. Earning gold cups in the Grand Prix mode across various difficulty levels is the only way to unlock a couple secret goodies, so while all characters are available from the bat, the game still tries to incentivize you to tackle all challenge levels. Beating all levels is also a good way to collect lots of coins, which you will need to unlock many of the parts you can use to customize your kart. Most standard parts will be unlocked once you reach 3100 coins total, but there are some super-secret ones that you will either need to hoard coins or master other modes to obtain. Despite the strength of single player, getting some friends together on the couch is where Mario Kart truly begins to shine. The game allows up to 4 players to compete on a single system in either traditional races or battles. And up to 8 Switch consoles can connect wirelessly so everyone can play with their own screen. This is helpful as trying to play with more than two players while using the system’s tablet screen in tabletop mode can make it difficult for you to effectively track your position. One of the new highlights that especially comes alive with multiple players is the freshly revamped battle mode. Learning from the mistakes of the original version, battles once again take place in open arenas as opposed to race tracks, making it far easier to chase down opponents and make some lovely chaos. Modes from previous games, such as Balloon Battle, Bob-omb Blast and Shine Thief make their return, and are joined by a brand new battle type called “Renegade Roundup”, which is essentially a Mario-style game of cops and robbers that finds “the law” using Pirahna Plants on their karts to try and gobble up “renegades”, who are trying to dodge the law while freeing their trapped allies. Each mode provides a fun twist that can change up strategies from match to match. Online play is also available in MK8D, and while the game plays incredibly smoothly with little to no lag, the features online still feel a little barren. There is no in-game voice chat, meaning that friends playing together will have to find other means of communication. You can create a room for just your friends, but there is currently no means of sending said friends an invitation, once again necessitating an alternate form of communication in order to coordinate races or battles. You can organize your own tournaments as well…but again, getting people to join requires you get word out about what time it takes place around the net, although at least there is an option to browse current tournaments you can join. Hopefully, once Nintendo releases the full online suite for the Switch, it will provide an easier means of inviting friends to play online. Apart from the massive changes to battle mode and the increased local multiplayer ability, most of the changes to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe are a little more subtle. Players can now carry up to two items instead of just one, and it is possible to charge up a mini-turbo even further while drifting around corners. More apparent from the get –go is the roster of characters, which is completely unlocked from the beginning as opposed to unlocking drivers with gold cups like in the original title. All characters made available as DLC in the original title come packed right in right from the get go (in addition to all the additional tracks). On top of an already large roster of characters, series veterans Bowser Jr., Dry Bones and King Boo finally make their return to the kart championship. And joining them are two brand new characters, the Inklings from Splatoon. There’s even a Splatoon-themed arena in battle mode, based off of a stage from the first game.  The added benefit of being able to play the Switch on the go means that this game and its quick, 3-to-5 minute races make a perfect portable game as well. If all this feels like a lot to take in, that’s because this game is easily the most full featured Mario Kart in Nintendo’s history, and is easily the definitive version of the game up to this point. What The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild provides for a single player adventure, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe provides as well for the friends who just wanna flop on the couch, grab some controllers, and cause some chaos while testing the strength of their friendships. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a must-have for the Switch, and I heartily recommend its purchase as soon as you get the chance.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61+NCV08IaL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Z5gmcLcQL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71i2HA3FFHL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tYey72olL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ucoQ8MahL._SY1600.jpg","","false","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R277FIILDQGXYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

My favorite character is King Boo which is among one of the new characters as well as the Splatoon Characters. There are new splatoon vehicles and new Battle Courses like coin runners where you can collect but steal others coins, the balloon battle includes more balloons, includes a bomb level, there is a map guide included at the lower right hand corner.  I'd say the major changes is within the battle mode as you have eight new levels only available in battle mode though, the battle options, but you also have new characters available and multiple attack weapon options for both battle and race mode.

"07/01/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","T. Azores","Speaking as someone who's barely played video games at all, ever...","...Mario Kart 8 is my jam. :)I had my heart set on buying a Nintendo Switch, so I did that. And I decided that Mario Kart 8 would be my first video game. I wanted something cartoon-y and fun, not something deep, serious or profound. I have no experience at all with playing Zelda games, so I wasn't sure that'd be a wise choice for a first game. But Mario Kart? Come on. It's a racing game. You choose a character, you choose a vehicle, and you drive your heart out in those races, with the gorgeous racetracks. (My favorite is Rainbow Road.) Sure, there are pitfalls and traps, but it's still not hard to understand what you're supposed to be doing. It's an extremely easy game to pick up. And I think it's really easy to do well enough in the races to unlock vehicles, wheels or gliders.So I'm not the person to talk to about video games because like I said--I barely play them. I'm a casual gamer who likes mobile games like Diner Dash or tycoon games like Tap Tycoon. I don't consider those to be real video games. They're still games, sure, but I think those are the games you play to kill time when you're away from home. They aren't games that you actually set aside time for to play. So I don't consider myself a gamer, and I don't have a lot of experience with games for consoles like the Nintendo Switch. But I can tell you, Mario Kart 8 is a lot of fun. It's a great first game to play on the Switch. And I think this is an especially good choice if you don't play a lot of console games--because this game is meant to be easy to play, even if you're starting from zero with video games in general.

Instead of driving aimlessly through regular courses hoping you pass someone, they have created battle-specific courses, making battle more intense. There are 5 different modes in battle: balloon battle, coin runner, renegade roundup, ba-bomb blast, and shine thief. All are great. Our family favorite is Renegade Roundup.Beginner modeThey have added two new features that make this game more bearable while playing with small children. You can turn on your rc (at least that's what we call it. It gives you an antenna that makes your kart look like an RC car). This will make it so you cannot fall off the track. If you have this on, the game doesn't allows you to take some of the secret shortcuts.They also have an auto accelerator. This makes it so you do not have to push the gas the entire race.We were hesitant to buy this because it's basically the same as the WiiU version, but their improvements made it worth the money.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REUEARKE3RFUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","85","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

The visuals are beautiful, and there are plenty of courses and abundant customization options. The only small drawbacks have been noted by other reviewers already;:It is too easy to turn on smart steering accidentially, and this mode is not much of a challenge even for novice players, it seems to be more for little kids, which is fine, but there should be some way to turn it off by default. Also, the instructions are lacking, and I had to go to youtube to figure out how to turn on motion control. I feel motion control should be the default given how the Switch controllers work (others might disagree), but a little instruction booklet included with the game might have made things easier.These are small gripes, the game is the most fun Mario Kart ever, therefore 5 stars.Oh, my biggest wish:Please, Nintendo: I would love Pikachu as a playable driver!

"06/15/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","David T. Robinson","Just like the great Mario Kart 8 but with Battle Mode and new characters","Mario Kart. It's the best arcade racer ever created. I can't possibly add to what's already been said about Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U and this follow up, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. What makes this version better isn't so much the new true Battle Mode or the new characters but how the game plays on the Switch platform itself.A friend of mine with a Switch console and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe took our systems to a company retreat held at an outdoor facility where a huge rainstorm left the field wet and muddy. We decided to use some free time to play some Mario Kart with our systems with wireless local multiplayer. Soon people began looking on as we played. We both detached the JoyCons on each of our consoles, which allowed one additional player per console to join in with the Switch units propped on a table top. Eventually this grew into a crowd and we opted to then use a docked Switch console to connect to a projector where we easily synced our pairs of JoyCons to allow four player multiplayer on this single console. This is where Nintendo's Switch console and games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe shine. The flexibility of the console and simple fun of Mario Kart made for a very entertaining afternoon that was enjoyed by gamers and non-gamers alike.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RUGKYPTNKN38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","7","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"06/08/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","rodjoh","Woohoo! Deja vu!","Mario Kart 8 was a great game on the Wii U and it is still the best Mario Kart ever released.Mario Kart 8 Deluxe brings all the fun of the original version plus adds a few more features to it.The game looks as beautiful as ever, and runs smoothly. Perhaps even better than on Wii U due to the higher resolution supported by the new hardware.Now, and this is probably the thing I like the most about it, is that we finally have a console-quality Mario Kart game to play on the go. While all the portable Mario Kart games have been good enough, the console versions have always been superior by far. The fact that we can fit the entire Mario Kart 8 experience in our pockets now is a reality feels surreal.Mario Kart 8 Deluxe features all the tracks, characters, DLC and features from the orginal straight from the box. No unlocking... well actually scratch that, you do have to unlock the kart parts again. But all tracks and characters are ready to go from the start.If you never played MK8, you can expect a great arcade racing game with all the crazy combat action you can expect from the series. There's a few things you need to know.- Coins are back. Collect coins across the tracks to increase your max speed.- New items such as the Boomerang and the Pirahna Plant.- Antigrav mechanics, now you can ride your kart even on walls and upside down at certain sections.- As in Mario Kart 7, vehicles can be customized. You can glide through the air and drive underwater as well.- Mario Kart 8 for the first time in the series features cameo characters and tracks from other Nintendo games such as Zelda, Animal Crossing, Fzero, Excitebike and Splatoon.- Go all the way from 50cc up to 200cc for the first time. Yes, it is crazy fast and makes the game a lot harder than you'd expect.The Deluxe version brings a revamped Battle Mode that is actually fun to play, with the classic modes Coin Runners, Shine thieft, Balloon Battle, Bob Omb Blast and more. This definitely makes the experience feel more complete. It also brings back the ability to hold 2 items at the same time which hasn't been done since Gamecube's Mario Kart Double Dash.I don't know if the existance of this port means that Switch won't get its' own proper MK9. Hopefully it still does. Right now this is too much deja vu for my liking. But I do love MK8 and while I was ready for something new at this point, I'm just happy I can take this excellent gem wherever I go.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NE3V06ZI9EGF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","4","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

There are new carts, wheels, and gliders however, as well as characters. The reason this gets 4 stars is the battle modes! They are hilarious, especially when playing with friends. I think a fair price would've been $30-40 but they are slow to release games on the switch right now and I've been playing Mario kart since the n64. The HD graphics are fantastic and the portability is amazing. I have to use the pro controller the small ones are hard with my big hands. The COMs seem to be smarter and more difficult vs the Wii U version. It was a fun challenge and always a hoot to rewind the highlight reel and see how you dropped from 1st to 8th on the last lap 5 seconds away from the finish line lol","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TZH4YSKWPOY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

Well, let me tell you. You may be a bit disappointed to hear that it's basically the same. The NEW additions are:-the Battle Mode (this was revamped, adding new modes and new stages),-Inkling Boy/Girl,-some Splatoon kart customizations,-Boo item,-Feather item (only available in battle mode),-Smart Steering OPTION (helps with not falling off the stage),-auto-accelerate OPTION (let's your kart move, without holding the gas button. GREAT FOR YOUNG players),-online mode was changed a bit.Also, the previous DLC packs for Wii U version, are included. With that being said, I think there's just enough that was added, to buy again if you were a MK8 U owner. If you never got your hands on the Wii U version, this is absolutely a MUST-BUY.

Everything about this game is fun, and the challenges keep coming with new moods exclusive to the Nintendo Switch!If you have ever played MarioKart before, this is more of the same - fast, fun, and never-ending excitement. I don't think your the person I need to sell on this.If you have never played Mario Kart, and you have a Nintendo Switch...I mean, what are you waiting for??? Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is not just another racing game - you race underwater, through the skies, upside down, through a toybox; there is so much to see and do and learn here. Plus, there is a learning curve, and the game is designed to help you become a better racer gradually, while still letting you take home the Gold cup. Single player is great, and playing this on the go with the Switch is ideal because each race is never longer than 5 minutes total. You could easily power it up in the doctor's waiting room and probably finish a few Cups before being called back.And the multiplayer is great! There are other features designed to help even the odds between veterans and new-comers. From the Grand Prix to the Battles, it's anyone's game to win! The online is much more challenging, but after completing all the 150cc cups with Gold, you should be set to take anyone on.If you have a Nintendo Switch and don't have Mario Kart 8, you should question why you bought it in the first place.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QSHWQIKLFFVX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","3","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

The only thing you can really unlock is kart customizations which, if you're any sort of decent at mario kart, hardly matter much besides their looks.Graphics are incredible, and there are a bunch of little details Nintendo added in that give this game the classic Nintendo feel with a bit of modernization.The racing mechanics are fun and easy to master with a little practice, as long as you shut off the drive-assist which is enabled by default (why?).Definitely brought back some good nostalgia, and I'm sure I'll play it... sometimes.I love Nintendo- die-hard fan- but man, please give us something new!There's very little replayability to the game. After beating each stage on 50, 100, and 150cc all I wanna do is scream what's new?The addition of link to the game was a welcome surprise and the hyrule themed map made me smile ear to ear.

I did not own a WiiU for varying reasons, therefore could not own Mario Kart 8. One of the most enticing parts about purchasing this game is that is already comes with some new content, as well as the DLC from the WiiU version of Mario Kart 8. This is a great game to enjoy by yourself, with friends, with family, and will definitely keep children busy. The Joy-Cons that come with the switch act as two controllers, so you are already guaranteed to be able to have two people enjoy this game at the same time. I would recommend also investing in a Pro-Controller or second pair of Joy-Cons if you find playing the game with just one Joy Con difficult. Overall the game's graphics are nice, keeping that cartoon feel Nintendo has done so well with for so long.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MI4XA0K2M0OX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","11","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

I have played all of them. This one was exactly what I expected. I try not to hype myself up for unrealistic things like them making a new game when they have many reviews and have stated exactly what you get with this game. This game is the same as the nintendo WII mario cart with added bonuses, like they added new maps, New Amiibos, New commands, and some other little things. I loved the mario cart on my WII U so I got this one knowing I would also love this one. However, I will give fair cons on this review so people will be not caught off guard. The online mode has issues, the network does go down and I have a very good internet provider. They have also warned people if you want to continue to play online they will be adding a SUB fee in the future. We have no idea how much that will be for. For now though I really like this game, If you can look past those cons and enjoyed the WII U version of this game you should be happy with the switch version as well.

We played for hours until the Switch had to be charged and helped relieve the awkwardness until dinner. The only thing keeping me from absolutely loving this game is the online play is a bit laggy. Sometimes we get hit by things we can't see or connection errors come up and we all have to remake the instance for someone to reconnect. As to be expected with the first couple weeks of launch but it is a bit frustrating. Especially when the A communication error has occurred pops up and we all get disconnected from each other. A good ol' hard reboot on our Switch devices usually fixes this for a few days though, so maybe an issue with the Switch?I will note, not sure if it was due to shipping or if it was damaged prior but the case has a thumb-sized hole at the top. Not that it really mattered for me, I put all my games in a carrying case and recycle the stock boxes.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14Z0OWFDQCYY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"05/07/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","Scott","Great Game, But Still Has Online Connection Issues","Wii U owners might remember that the original Mario Kart 8 was released for that home console back in 2014. Three years later, and we now have Mario Kart Deluxe, a way for Nintendo to capitalize on their huge Mario Kart fan-base without dedicating too much time and money into producing the 9th iteration of the franchise this early into the Nintendo Switch's lifespan. For the most part, Deluxe is identical to the original MK8, with a couple new features included to give players a reason to pay full price again for what is essentially the same game. These include additional Battle Modes, some new tracks, characters and vehicles, all the DLC from the original Wii U version, and some refinements to online multiplayer (such as being able to change vehicles and characters without leaving the online multiplayer lobby). Of course, the main draw to getting Deluxe is being able to play Mario Kart 8 on a handheld device, which for all intents and purposes has now eliminated the reason for players to still be using Mario Kart 7 for the 3DS. However, the real question is if all these minor enhancements are enough to make MK8 players spend full price again on what is essentially the same game. The answer to that is two-fold. For people who still own a Wii U system and the original Mario Kart 8, I would not recommend getting Deluxe. However, if you're planning on selling your Wii U and upgrading to the Nintendo Switch, or you never bought a Wii U in the first place, then yes, I would recommend getting Deluxe, as it will probably be several more years before we see a true Mario Kart 9 sequel.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UCYTBCR8AR9Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","8","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"05/07/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Kyle D.","Childhood Fun!","I remember first playing Mario Kart back shortly after the launch of the Super Nintendo. I was hooked from day one. I'd rush home after school to play against my friends, my sibling, and even my parents. As time went on my friends and I got older and moved on to play late night 4 player battle modes on the N64. Even more time went on and all of a sudden we found ourselves too busy in adulthood to dork out like we did as kids.Now in my early 30s, I knew I wanted a Switch from the moment it was announced. I knew, deep down, that it would deliver on the key franchises that I loved so much growing up.I'm happy to report that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe ABSOLUTELY delivers. From the gorgeous and smooth graphics to the wonky sound effects and quick styled gameplay - it's a TON of fun. Like Zelda, it's a blast to my childhood past, and that's something I cannot put a price on. Well played Nintendo. 10 out of 10 stars!","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71536r7jqGL._SY1600.jpg","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HU6S3R0BWSVO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","9","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"
"05/07/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","3","KfX","Good racing game for KIDS","Continues the MarioKart series very well. It has good graphics and lots of characters and cosmetic options to choose from to dress up your vehicle. Still, gameplay seems very youth oriented, like Lego and Disney Infinity games are. The cosmetic options don't give added powers or abilities, like speed or durability, its for appearances only. This game is definitely one for young kids rather than adult gamers, unless you're a diehard Mario Kart fan.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R346J58LBC72O7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","1","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

The new guidance option also makes it possible for my daughters (2 and 5) to play alongside me, and they have a lot of fun being able to race and throw items around without falling off the track all of the time.In addition, since the Switch's JoyCon use joysticks instead of d-pads, I can stop using motion controls for steering across the board, which I had to pick up for Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart 8, due to the controller types that I had available.  This is just a preference, though, as the motion controls are reliable for this game, as well.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RC5I12YZDIYD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

I think that's why we were not AMAZED when we played this version for the Switch.  The game looks and feels exactly the same as the Wii U version.  There are some tweaked changes to it.  New Characters such as Bowser Jr., Dry Bones, Gold Mario, Inkling Boy, Inkling Girl, and King Boo.  We never really used the battle mode but there are some new tracks for that mode.  They have some new vehicles as well.  The online mode has tournaments and you can add friends on your Switch  from the people you recently played with.  Regular Prix mode has a 200cc option now.  I like the ability to split the Joy Con remote with a second player.I highly enjoy Mario Kart and I really hope my thoughts on the Deluxe version change over time.  Hopefully with the ability to add new DLC on the switch we may see new tracks.  I really feel that is what this version is missing.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FF77WXGZ1UCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","1","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"05/02/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","C. Taylor","Great classic game back and better than ever with modern updates!","Pre-ordered from Amazon for the Switch, and it's our favorite game, so far. Not going to lie, MARIO nostalgia runs big in this family, and even the next generation is already a big MARIO fan. All the great aspects of the classic MARIO Kart games have been preserved. The battles, the races, the ability to edge out your opponents with banana peels, turtle shells or a good old fashioned side swipe. There are tons of classic Nintendo characters to chose from, as well as courses from other Nintendo franchises. Let's just say Link for Zelda is a favorite for one of the kids. As parents, we enjoy battling each other in some good, healthy competition. Oh, I should mention the graphics look great on our tv, too!My only complaint is more to do with the game system than the game. Initially we played the game with a pro controller and the joy con L/R controllers locked into its base to make it work like a pro. The left joy con kept shorting out like it was having an interference problem. We had to ditch the pro controller and each use one of the tiny Joy Cons (I used the left and husband used the right). It fixed the issue, but they are so tiny they aren't as fun to hold like that. However, I have noticed the L joy com joy stick act a little funny with other games, so I'm not docking a star as it may be more of a Switch issue. I have read about other Switch owners having a similar problem. My advice - if you can afford the pro controllers at the hefty $69.99 a piece price tag, buy two of those to play this game.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2QQ7OCL7SK7UM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"05/02/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Dudley","BEST MARIO KART, IF NOT GAME, EVER!","Sorry for the all caps, I just love this game. I had always wanted Mario Kart 8, but sadly I never owned a Wii U.There is a very wide variety of tracks, being 48 in total (32 from the original game and 12 from the dlc). All the tracks are creative and have their perks, as with any Mario Kart game.BATTLE MODE IS BACK! There was a battle mode on Mario Kart 8, but it was famous for being lazy (It used race tracks from the game and only had balloon battles). This is all fixed in Deluxe, with eight dedicated battle courses and five battle modes, all of which are amazing.There are new/returning characters such as Bowser Jr., King Boo, and INKLINGS! Still no Birdo or Diddy Kong, though.The graphics are updated to 1080p and 60fps docked, from 720p and an odd 59fps on the Wii U.There are very few flaws, those being small things such as the coin item being too prominent or Pink Gold Peach being a character.This is the highest reviewed Mario Kart game to date, with the highest first day attach rate. It broke the first day sales record of Mario Kart Wii. This game is AMAZING!I didn't even mention double items! They are a game changer!It is very accessible for new players with options such as smart steering and auto acceleration. The only problem is that they are very easy to toggle on, so be careful.I would definitely recommend. 10/10!","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61FOvIRgvbL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PfqHvXfbL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71l8Uv2dMVL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oVjZkDCkL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81BkSpg0kWL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81K+N+lA8BL._SY1600.jpg","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTRQJ46L6SMX5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","1","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

This was my game when I was younger, and having it now just brings it all back!  All of the tracks are gorgeous and fun to play.  There's enough of them with enough variety where everyone will find favorites.  The wide roster of characters to select from add to the fun!  I never expected to be playing Link in Mario Kart ever, and had a blast as him!  I've already dabbled in the battle modes, and those seem just as entertaining as I remember!  It sounds like the WiiU's version was lacking in this department, so I'm glad they made the improvements.  It's nice having the option to bank up 2 special toys to use on your competition from the mystery boxes, and I find it fun unlocking customization for my Karts.Its an exceptional game that I'm glad got a port to the Switch from the WiiU.  It is an older game though, so some who already HAVE it from the WiiU days may be a bit disappointed in not getting much fresh and new with this installment.  I'd give it a 4.5 Stars if I could simply because it is an older game that people have already on a different system.  I'd like to encourage Nintendo to have Switch era games available/developed like in the case of Zelda Breath of the Wild, so I believe a mild dock of stars would be appropriate.  Can't wait to play the next generation of Nintendo!","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NLQ5XNZLNO55/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","2","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

With brilliant graphics, endless kart customizations, and numerous old and new courses to choose from, this is a no-brainer for the Switch. Since it is the Deluxe version, all of the DLC characters and cups are included leaving you only with kart customizations to unlock. That is very generous and makes it easy to just turn on and play from the get go. The new and old Battle modes were missing from the Wii U version and definitely bring new excitement to the multiplayer experience. I would comment on the Switch to Switch LAN type plan, but I don't know anyone else with a Switch.

I've only played single player mode, which is pretty boring (I always get 1st place). Online play is where it's at, even tho I am consistently in 12th place and losing points, it's still fun. I understand that Nintendo plans to make their online gaming a subscription based model before the end of 2017, so we'll see if I'm singing the same tune then.Tried it with various controllers: a bare naked Joy-Con, a Joy-Con in one of those steering wheels, the Joy-Con comfort grip, and the Pro controller. As expected, the Pro controller is the most comfortable and best way to play.

"04/30/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Clare","Best Mario Kart Yet","Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is some of the best fun I've had in a while. I myself had skipped the Wii U entirely, but I had played the Wii U version at friends' houses. This is the definitive version of Mario Kart with a great mixture of new tracks and remastered old ones. And the added bonus of all the DLC tracks is pretty sweet too.Graphics: 5/5 This game runs at 60fps on and off the TV and at 1080p on the TV and 720p on the screen. For comparison, the Wii U version maxed out at 720p.Gameplay: 5/5 The different ways to race (antigravity, glider, and underwater) make this game both fun and difficult at some times.Battle Mode: 5/5 If you are a Wii U owner this is probably why you would purchase this game. There are several new battle modes (Renegade Roundup, Bomb Blast, Shine Theif) that give you something else to play besides the usual coin runners and balloon battle.Controls: 4/5 Some control schemes are better than others, but all of them are solid options. When I'm playing single player I like to use the joycon grip because the L and R buttons are bigger than when using the SL and SR on a single joycon.Music: 5/5 All of the tracks sound great and I love the emphasis on saxophone (I'm a sax player myself). On the DLC tracks like Zelda and Animal Crossing it's cute to see how they revamped the classic tunes for racing. And on the Cloudtop Cruise course you can even hear some hints of Super Mario Galaxy's Gusty Garden theme.Overall this is a great game and a must have for the switch, especially if you've never owned the Wii U version.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R288X14KCJ5A6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","1","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

It's an awesome package that is well worth the price of admission if you own a Switch (actually, it's a must have).  I really can say nothing bad about the game.  It's Mario Kart, and I feel it's the best MK to this day.  Love it.On the downside, I did order this Prime, and thought I'd have it the day it was released, but no. I received this the day after it was released.  Kind of a bummer when you go into a store and it's sitting on the shelf and you realize that yours is still on a truck somewhere between my house and some place in California.  It's not a huge deal, but when you read that if you preorder that you'll get it the day of release, and then you don't, it's kind of a let down and you start to think differently when maybe preordering from them again.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RB7ZLQ16BOLUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","7","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

The graphics are amazing, there are a lot of tracks, you can hold 2 items again, and it has all the features you would expect of a modern day Mario Kart. Overall... it's an ok game. Random non-Mario characters being in it, needing to collect coins, and gliding/underwater/zero gravity wall-driving all take away from the fun of racing. I personally also think that items are too big of a factor in winning (although it's not nearly as bad as the Wii Mario Kart was in this aspect).I'm actually quite disappointed in this game so far, but I'm sure it'll be much more fun once I can play with friends.

It doesn't make sense for families to own multiple copies of the same game.

First off, I'm actually surprised at how clean and crisp this game looks. I do not remember the Wii U version POPPING out of my screen like the Switch version does. It could be my 4K TV, idk, but man. The game is gorgeous and smooth. Gameplay is the same, which is great, but as I was racing and drifting, I noticed my Sparks turn purple.They added another GOT DANG DRIFT BOOST I'M SWEATIN, NOOBS BE WARNED WHEN I HOP ONLINE AND PREPARE TO GET CREAMED.I had no idea beforehand that they were doing that. I was excited. Little things like that, alongside the inclusion of more characters, a proper battle mode, and more make this purchase worth it.

"04/29/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","1","Amazon Customer","Boring, arrived several days late","Not very fun. It's my first Mario Kart game. I thought I would get to customize the cart to upgrade the speed/abilities of your preferred cart, but it's all cosmetic with minor tweaks to stats. Maybe this is a good game for people with a lot of friends or something but single player is really boring. Not a game worth the full retail price. Also I pre-ordered it from Amazon and it arrived several days late. I wish I had not bought the Switch until more games came out.Game is very repetitious. Customizing the karts do almost nothing to their abilities, it's all just about how it looks. All players are unlocked already so there is nothing really to accomplish in the game unless you want to get some tires or something.You can only collect 10 coins at a time in the race to unlock the cosmetics, which is silly.My idea of a fun racing game was Star Wars Episode 1 Podracer. You could pick different engines and bodies for interesting combinations. Like you could pick a body that was tougher but slower, engines that were faster but made your racer harder to control etc. In this case, this is basically a little kid party game or something where nothing you do matters.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9ZKY1D96T6TK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","5","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"04/29/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Just Me","It's Nintendo, It's amazing","I will start with the bad:1 and 2 actually have to do with the setup of controllers rather than the game.1. If using separate the right joy con sync button is millimeters from the use item button.2. If using separate the home button to go to the main menu Is very easily pressed if younger player is using the controller or someone with bigger hands? I could easily hold it differently but I also wear an xs women's glove.3. Not enough new content for those who had the original MK8 since release which I know is the minority of people. I've only had MK8 since August and played maybe a dozen or so times and while I love MK8D for pure nostalgia and clean entertainment, just like I still play MK64, I wouldn't otherwise. It would collect dust and would make me angry that really there's nothing new racing wise. Pickings are slim for games on the switch a few new tracks really would make a huge difference in most people's minds.The good:1- My 4 year old finished in 4th in a race 8th overall! No one had to finish playing then do her 3 laps! She didn't give up in frustration halfway through a tournament. No complaining that she lost. The auto acceleration and steering is amazing.2- Perfect family game.3- I am not a techie but whoever says the picture quality is pretty much the same is crazy! Or they need a new tv. I have a 4 month old Samsung 1080p tv 42 inches and the picture quality is amazing.

"04/29/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","1","JVP","Families Beware!!! Each Switch Console needs its own cartridge disk.","After jumping through hoops to get 3 Nintendo Switch consoles, 1 for me and 2 for my kids,  my Switch excitement balloon has officially popped.  The whole focus of Switch is portable personal console.  When I first heard of Switch and Mario Kart 8, I had visions of family races by the campfire while on vacation. Even though I found it expensive, I thought if it keeps the kids from fighting while on a long road trip, they can have 1 each.  I tried to read as much about how local multiplayer would be, but all I dug up was speculation.  Now that I have a copy of MKD8, I can't help but feel really angry because Nintendo expects us to drop an additional $60 for each console.  To me, that is just being greedy.  Yes you can play up to 4 players on 1 console, but it is not as fun as each family member holding their own personal console.  I do not usually write reviews, but I am doing so first, to warn people about needing a cartridge disk for each console. And second, maybe it will start a revolution of bad reviews so that Nintendo will come up with a policy that lets families with more than one console only need to buy a game title once.","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQQN873P3GUI5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","25","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"04/28/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","4","SodaPop","Even though it's a port, it's a great game.","As a Wii U owner, I was disappointed when Nintendo announced Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for Nintendo Switch, a port of Mario Kart 8 for Wii U. I bought Mario Kart 8 and all its DLC, only to be greeted by this!  Nonetheless, I decided to purchase the game to strengthen my game library. (The 20% discount from pre-ordering through Amazon Prime helped sweeten the deal.)Now that I have played the game, I decided to review it so I could tell everyone every major thing that is new in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (MK8D), and, if you owned the Wii U version of Mario Kart 8 (MK8U), whether I think it's worth the upgrade...and the $60.Note: if you aren't a MK8U owner but own the Nintendo Switch, then stop reading this review and buy MK8D! It is a must-have in the MK family. The game will be a brand new experience for you, and you will love it!Now let me tell you about all the major changes in MK8D.- The game runs at default 1080p and 60 fps in TV Mode, in contrast to the Wii U's default 720p. (In Handheld and Tabletop modes it is reduced to 720p. When there are 3 or 4 players, it is reduced to 30 fps.)- You can play MK8 ANYWHERE, with ANYONE, at ANYTIME!- All DLC from MK8U is included in MK8D.- Every thing is unlocked from the start, except car parts and Gold Mario.- You can now hold two items at once, which was one of my favorite elements of Mario Kart: Double Dash!! The Double item box also returns from Double Dash.- There are two new items: Boo and Feather, which is exclusive to Battle mode.- There is a third level of mini-turbo, called Ultra Mini-turbo and represented by purple sparks.- Smart Steering is an optional feature that prevents you from falling off the track.Auto Accelerate is also an optional feature that causes your kart to accelerate automatically. (These features can be set to on/off for each individual player.)- There are 5 new characters: King Boo, Bowser Jr., Dry Bones, Inkling Girl, and Inkling Boy. (You can also unlock Gold Mario, a variant of Metal Mario.)- The battle mode has been completely revamped,(Because Wii U owners know that MK8U's battle mode sucked.) and may I say, it is STELLAR!!! This is the greatest Battle Mode ever! Even people who say that Battle Mode isn't their favorite will (probably) LOVE this! Battle across 1 of 8 Battle arenas in 1 of 5 different modes: Pop balloons in Balloon Battle, catch the renegades or dodge the law in Renegade Roundup, be greedy in Coin Runners, throw bombs in Bob-omb Blast, and steal and flee in Shine Thief.And that's everything new in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe! So the question is... is MK8 worth purchasing a second time? The answer is YES! Even though I don't like when developers make a do-over of a game, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is tolerable. I docked a star just because it's a port and it's $60, but other than that it's great (but if Nintendo makes a Super Smash Bros. 4 port I'm gonna lose it...).","","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1R3QDZETZ7UEZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","6","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

"04/28/2017","United States 🇺🇸 ","5","Vincent","List of Changes (Compared to the Wii U version)","This is the definitive edition version of Mario Kart 8, and a must buy for those who never owned the Wii U version. For those who already own the Wii U version, the changes may or not be worth it depending on what you're looking for. Without further ado here are the list of changes compared to the Wii U version:1. 1080p with higher frame rate* when docked (TV mode) instead of 720p (on Wii U). Tabletop  mode it's still 720p. Frame rate TV mode is 60fps, off TV mode is 59fps. Yes, one frame makes a difference when comparing side-by-side and/or when you have been playing dozens of hours of the original2. 5 new characters: King Boo, Bowser Jr, Dry Bones, & Inklings (Boy and Girl)3. Characters can now carry up to two items at once, even if they don't drag the first item4. Double Item Box. Get two items when you run through a double item box or two singles. Note that you cannot swap items back and forth5. Smart Steering A mode that prevents you from running off course or into a puddle of water. Good for toddlers or young children getting into the game (especially on the rainbow road courses). If the Smart Steering mode is on, the player's vehicle will have an antenna sticking out its rear end. The antenna blinks when Smart Steering is active.6. Auto-accelerate for beginners. Can be used in conjunction with Smart Steering, essentially you don't have to hold down the accelerate button. Again, good for young children who just want to drive through the track without any stop-gaps. Works well when using the wheel peripheral7. All DLC (from Wii U) included. Everything is unlocked from beginning except kart parts and Gold Mario. Kart Parts are unlocked by playing through the game and collecting coins. Gold Mario unlocked by winning all of the 200cc grand prix cup8. Time Trials in the 200cc engine class have been added. Also added  are new ghosts of Nintendo employees to race against9. Ultra Mini-Turbo, denoted by pink/purple sparks that appear after the orange sparks which makes you boost significantly faster. Cannot be used with smart steering on10. Online Play.-Option to change character and vehicle combinations during an online lobby without having to leave/exit out; this is done by pressing the Y button during the course selection screen of an online lobby.- You can see what lap everyone is in, in spectator mode if you finish early-When you win a match you get to wear a crown in the main online menu screen for everyone in the lobby to see. Hat also present when you're in the lead during a match- More icon packs for tournament mode11. Faster loading times. Just a few seconds, but it adds up overtime. If you purchase Mario Kart Deluxe digital over the physical you get 1-2 secs off each track loading screen12. New amiibo compatibility. You now get racing suits when scanning in specific amiibo13. Boo and feather (battle mode only) item return to the game14. You get the same 48 courses racing courses. But you get 5 additional new battle stages in battle mode + 3 retro stages15. The Villager in now split between male and female selectable characters with different stats bringing the roster to the total of 42 characters (excluding character variants. Example: different color yoshis/shy guys, create your own mii, etc)16. Graphical change: Motion Blur, High Quality Shadows, Confetti now drop to the ground showing animation at start of match17. Battle mode: Biggest change in terms of gameplay. There are 4 battle mode game types:-Balloon Battle. Traditional Arena Style (no more battling in a circle) Mario Kart Battle mode where you use items to pop your opponent's balloons or steal them via feather item in order to score points.-Renegade Round Up. Cops and Robbers style setup. One team with the potted piranha plants try to capture all the other team before time runs out. Once captured your teammate can also free you from your jail cell-Bob-omb Blast. Same as balloon battle, but you only carry bombs-Coin Runner. Collect as many coins in the stage as you can before time runs out-Shine Thief. A keepway style game where you have to hold the Shrine Sprite the longest before time runs out. The driver holding the shrine sprite will have their speed lower the longer they hold it==Additional notes: - There's 4 player split screen in docked (TV mode) and handheld/table top mode. Note that the screen for table top mode is really small and may be a problem for those who are far-sighted. When playing 2 player it's 60fps, 3 or more on the same screen it'll drops down 30fps-There's no Download Play, so you have to play split screen or have another copy of the game if you don't want to share the same screen or play more than 4 players-Stamps do not make a return since the Switch doesn't have miiverse-No more gamepad/duel screen when playing TV mode, so this time around you cannot see what items everyone is holding by glancing down-No voice chat (as of this review) unfortunately. Was present in the Wii U version with mic hardware (which no one bought). There's supposed to be a smart phone app that takes advantage of voice chat, but no word yet from Nintendo-Statistics of the vehicle parts and drivers have also been changed to make game more balanced-Other balance changes:Fire Hopping have been removed: An exploit in the Wii U version where you can repeatedly hop from left to right to get extra speed from turboboost.Blue shell dodge exploit still present. It's when you fall off the cliff the last second the blue shell is about to hit you, it'll save a lot of time recovering from the hit. Note this cannot be done when smart steering mode is on If a Blooper is about to ink the player as they cross the finish line, the player will still get inked. Red Shell Nerfed: If you're holding an item behind you while in the air, you can block a red shellEasier to break while drifting (advanced tactic)-Luigi still has his signature death stareIf there's anything I missed please put it in the comments.Overall, i personally think the best additions are the enhanced battle mode and the portability aspect as I can now play during my break period and commute to work. I already sunk in over 300+ hours on the Wii U version and the upgrade is totally worth it for me as I got more than my money's worth in the original game on Wii U and plan to sync 300+ on the Switch version especially with the ease of use due to it's portability, and 100+ more hours of play in battle mode play with housemates. Well that is my personal perspective, so if you are in a similar situation it's a very good buy. If not, I hope the list of changes helped you in your purchasing decision","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71RUZn2JlRL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rp-G1jWgL._SY1600.jpg, https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81VxSG+wwmL._SY1600.jpg","","true","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OQMZY1CQKQGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1037CV","1","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

Un excelente servicio al cliente.Ahora, hablando del juego... es bueno por el simple hecho de que es Mario Bros pero su competidor más directo es mejor en mi opinión. Crash Nitro Cart tiene más acción en las carreras, es más rápido y constantemente le están metiendo contenido nuevo. Mario Kart se queda corto en esos aspectos así que si tienes que escoger entre uno y otro, diría que Crash gana, pero si puedes comprar ambos entonces no hay más que pensar... ambos son una buena opción para jugar con amigos y en split screen","","","true","","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"

Juego Mario Kart desde el Nintendo 64 y creo que este es mi favorito hasta el momento. Tiene una GRAN variedad de personajes y pistas, con varias clásicas de juegos anteriores que han sido rediseñadas y se sienten como nuevas.Mi único pero es que extraño desbloquear jugadores y pistas ganando trofeos, cosa que en este juego ya no hay; desde que lo prendes por primera vez tienes acceso a todos los personajes y pistas, lo que le añade diversidad pero le quita un poquito de emoción.De ahí en fuera, si tienes Switch y nunca tuviste Wii U o si tuviste pero no te compraste Mario Kart 8 es tu momento de comprarlo, vale cada centavo.","","","true","","0","B01N1037CV","Platform For Display: Nintendo Switch | Edition: Standard"
